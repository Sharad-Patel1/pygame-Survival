To use this application the user will run this program like they would any other python program. 
    Python3 [game.py]

The user can also give some parameter tweaks:
    Zombies mode
        This is the game mode where the player is “locked” in the environment with randomly spawning zombies and they have to last for as long as they can. 
        The longer they last the higher the score is. 
            Played by inputting python3 [game.py] -z
    
    Normal Mode / Day mode
        This is the game mode where the player runs in an infinitely generating random map that spawns enemies and and they earn points by killing enemies
            Played by inputting python3 [game.py] -d 
    
    Night Mode
        This game mode is similar to the normal / day mode, but in this game mode the player is running through the map and its “night time” where the colors are a lot darker, and the enemies can only see the player when he gets within a certain range of them. 
            Played by inputting python3 [game.py] -n 

## Few Bugs

1. Zombies currently do no damage to the player, 
2. Sometimes while playing the player can if they go to the left side of the screen can fall off the playable area.
